    <h2><u>Projects</u></h2>
    <h3><u>Secure File Storage System Using Hybrid Cryptography:</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Developed a Java-based file storage system with MySQL database, implementing hybrid cryptography for secure file storage. <br> The system utilised AES for symmetric encryption and RSA for asymmetric encryption of keys. Features included secure key management, <br> file metadata storage, user authentication, access control, error handling, and logging. The project showcased proficiency in Java programming, <br> MySQL database management, cryptography, and security best practices.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The secure file storage system provided a reliable and user-friendly platform for users to store and manage their files securely. <br> By leveraging hybrid cryptography techniques, the system ensured the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive user data.<br>The project demonstrated proficiency in Java programming, database management with MySQL, cryptography concepts, and security best practices.

    <h3><u>Predicting the first stage of the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket will land successfully</u></h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Description:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The aim is to analyze historical data from SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launches to develop a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a successful landing for the first stage of the rocket. <br> The project will involve gathering data on various parameters such as weather conditions, launch trajectory, engine performance, and other relevant factors. <br> The dataset will be preprocessed, and machine learning algorithms will be applied to train the model. The goal is to create a reliable predictive model that can <br> assess the probability of a successful landing for future Falcon 9 missions.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><strong>Outcome:</strong></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Upon analyzing the historical data and training the predictive model, the project yielded valuable insights into the factors that significantly influence the success of the first stage landing for SpaceX Falcon 9 rockets. <br> The model successfully identified patterns and correlations between different parameters, allowing for accurate predictions on the likelihood of a successful landing. <br> By considering real-time data for upcoming launches, the model could be used to provide a probability estimate for the success of the first stage landing. <br> This outcome could assist SpaceX in making informed decisions and implementing potential optimizations to enhance the success rate of their landings in future missions.
